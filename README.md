# Keith Bot

Keith Bot is a simple JavaScript bot, that makes use of the [CCNetMC API](https://github.com/Shadowevil015/ccnetmc-api), and basic DiscordJS modules,
to send information about Nations, and help answer questions quickly.

Currently, Keith Bot is in a pre-alpha state, since I'm still actively learning DiscordJS (and JavaScript tbh), but hopefully it will one day be in the CCNet Discord.
