# Keith Bot

Keith Bot is a simple JavaScript/NodeJS bot, that makes use of the [CCNetMC API](https://github.com/Shadowevil015/ccnetmc-api), and DiscordJS,
to send information about Nations, such as user data, and to help answer questions quickly, with a uniform response.

Currently, Keith Bot is in "Released" state, there is not much more for me to add to the bot, and it's pretty stable (as in, there are no errors)

Hopefully later in this year, a more developed REST API will be introduced onto CCNet, which can provide more information about the server, such as player balances, Nation Allies, and more.
